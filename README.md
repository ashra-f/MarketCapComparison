# Portfolio Creator & Market Capitalization Comparison
> Currently working on a website for this project. 

## Users can perform the following:
## 1. Market Capitalization Comparison
  Pick two companies from a list of ten to compare their market capitalizations. Potential gains or losses will be displayed, such as: 
  - "If Apple had the same market cap as Saudi Aramco, the new price would be $140.14. That is a change of -13.55% from the current price!"
  - "If Saudi Aramco had the same market cap as Apple, the new price would be $11.84. That is a change of 15.67% from the current price!"
## 2. Portfolio Creator
  Create a portfolio from a select number of companies.
## 3. Company Creator
  Create a fictional company that will be displayed on the top 10 list, if the company is in it.
